# CS4347_Database_Project

## Deliverable 1

Deliverable 1 consists of normalzing the data given using a parser of some kind. This parser thus normalizes the data into the respective csv files based on the schema given.

## Deliverable 2

Deliverable 2 consists of building a terminal version of the library software. This includes the frontend interface methods that will later be built with GUI and the backend database itself that the program needs to interface with.

Built using Python 3.13.7
Using modules sqlite3, decimal, datetime, re, pandas, and tkinter

To run the program, first run the create_database.py, `python create_database.py`, script to create the database and tables. Then, run the main.py script to start the terminal version of the library software.

After running main.py, the user will be greeted with a terminal based menu. To select menu options, type the corresponding number and press enter.

## Deliverable 3

Deliverable 3 consists of building a terminal version of the library software. This includes the frontend interface methods displayed as a GUI and the backend database itself that the program needs to interface with.

Built using Python 3.13.7
Using modules sqlite3, decimal, datetime, re, pandas, and tkinter

To run the program, first run the create_database.py, `python create_database.py`, script to create the database and tables. Then, run the main.py script to start the GUI version of the library software.

After running main.py, the user will be greeted with a menu screen with 5 buttons.
To choose a menu option, simply click on one of the corresponding buttons.

Do note that some of the menus feature a messagebox callout that will need to be handled by the user. Particularly in the case of fines and borrower management.
